Notes for [Mathematical Foundations of  Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning).

## Basic Concepts

### State and action

- **State**: the agent’s status with respect to the environment. - The set of all the states is called the state space, denoted as $\mathcal{S}$.
- Different states can have different action spaces.

### State transition

When taking an action, the agent may move from one state to another. Such a process is called *state transition*. For example, if the agent is in state $s_1$ and selects action $a_2$, then the agent moves to state $s_2$. Such a process can be expressed as
$$
s_1 \overset{a_2}{\longrightarrow} s_2
$$

Mathematically, the state transition process can be described by conditional probabilities. In general, state transitions can be *stochastic* and must be described by conditional probability distributions.
